# ML-CW1
The report aims to identify the best classification model for car default loans predictions and analysis the effects of imbalanced data and feature importance.

The repository consist of two files - Assignment-Oversampling and Assignment-SMOTE. Each share the same content but using different balancing data methods. 
Both files will include the following topics:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Imbalanced data prediction with Random Forest
- Balanced data prediction 
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Decision Tree
  3) Random Forest
  4) Support Vector Machine
- Feature Importance (not include in Assignment-SMOTE)

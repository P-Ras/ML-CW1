The report aims to identify the best classification model for car default loans predictions and analysis the effects of imbalanced data and feature importance.

The repository consist of two files - Assignment-Oversampling and Assignment-SMOTE. Each share the same content but using different balancing data methods. 
Both files will include the following topics:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Imbalanced data prediction with Random Forest
- Balanced data prediction 
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Decision Tree
  3) Random Forest
  4) Support Vector Machine
- Feature Importance (not include in Assignment-SMOTE)
